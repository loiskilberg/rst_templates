Making Our Own Frames
*********************

At |llc|, we typically make our own art frames. We sell these frames to customers. We also use them to display our art at events, at galleries, and on our studio walls. Offering frames for sale is a service to our customers, which offers these benefits: 

* It saves the customer the time and hassle that would be required to get the art framed later.
* The customer may be giving the art to a third party. Having the art already framed makes it an attractive, quick, and easy gift to hand it to someone else, ready to hang on a wall.
* A frame protects the artwork so that the customer doesn't have to worry about how to store the art safely while unframed.
* Framing through |llc| is typically cheaper than a frame shop, since it is not our main product and we are not trying to make a large profit from it.
* The customer can be assured that we will make the frame look good with the art.

Framing is optional to our customers. A customer may prefer to leave artwork unframed because:

* It is less expensive upfront to buy artwork unframed. The customer can wait until later to find the funds to pay for framing.
* The customer may be happy with how the art appears unframed and may never desire to get it framed.
* The customer may be giving the art to a third party and may not know the end recipient's decorating style, which could affect the choice of frame.
* The customer may want to choose a frame from another source that has more choices, in order to match it to their own decorating style.
* The customer may prefer a different mat than what we offer, so it makes sense to wait until the customer changes the contents to frame the art.

We offer basic frame choices. We can also do custom framing beyond what we typically offer, which may cost more and take longer.

Why Make Our Own Frames?
========================

There are several reasons we choose to make our own frames: 

* We prefer to use wood frames. It is not always easy to find good, affordable, wood frames that have a consistent look when you need them. We choose wood because:

    - Wood frames provide a professional appearance.
    - Some art galleries require wood frames.
    - Wood is durable, so you don't need to worry about a flimsy frame falling apart during a show.
    - You can drill into the back of a wood frame to install the type of wiring that is often required by art galleries.
    
* We can control the quality.
* We typically save the customer money by framing art for them.
* We can save money for ourselves when framing our art for shows and events.
* We can make frames on demand at any time of day or night. This is a big advantage when doing last-minute preparations for an event.
* We can repair a damaged frame immediately as long as we have the parts.

What Types of Frames do We Make?
================================

more text will go here, add a table showing the frame types, define "glazing", perhaps talk about when to use plexi vs glass and how to tell them apart, maybe an external link to frame pictures on our Etsy shop

Preparing to Make Frames
************************

Making frames requires a bit of muscle strength, especially since we use a manually powered saw. It is a good idea to practice making frames before you are in a rush to complete an order. Here are some helpful hints to keep in mind:

* It takes time to make a frame. Allow enough time so you don't feel rushed or tired.
* It is helpful to have a vacuum cleaner handy to keep clean up the sawdust you will create.
* Expect mistakes!

    - Double-check all calculations and measurements before cutting anything.
    - Some equipment may be slightly faulty, so remember how to adjust for these slight situations.
    - Have extra materials in case a piece gets ruined.
    - If possible, start while you still have extra time, so that you won't be rushed in case you have to redo something.
    - Enjoy the beautiful product you will have made when you take the time to make or redo it correctly!

Obtaining the Needed Materials
==============================

The materials to make a frame will vary depending on the type of frame. Deciding how much of each material to keep on hand is usually finding a balance between:

* Funds available
* Expected demand
* Length of time available to complete an order (will you have time to wait for a moulding order to arrive once a customer places an order or when |llc| commits to participating in an event?)
* Storage space to hold the materials before making the frames

Gather your materials in plenty of time before you need them. We recommend allowing at least two weeks to restock supplies. Also, make sure there is enough moulding on hand before the last couple weeks in December each year, because our preferred supplier shuts down during that time period. 

Understanding the General Steps Involved
========================================

The steps below describe an overview of how you will make the frames. You may find that you are able to do some steps, wait, and then finish on another day. Creating parts of frames before receiving an order could save time later so that when you are a rush, maybe all you will have to do is secure the contents and finish up.

Make an Art Frame, General Steps
********************************

Follow these general steps to get the necessary materials and to produce an art frame. Click on a link within a step for more details:

#. Get the materials (TBD), more text might go here, maybe add a note to not order moulding that is too wide, heavy, or tall and tell my story of doing this.

#. Make the basic frame rectangle (TBD), more text might go here, this involves cutting, sanding, and joining moulding pieces. Maybe add a note that the basic frame rectangle could be stored and sold separately as is.

#. Prepare the contents (TBD), more text might go here, contents should already be mounted and matted if needed, you might need to add a foam core backing to make the back level with the frame, add a liner if making a shadow box, remove any covers on plexiglass, add a caution of how to dispose of broken glass.

#. Secure the contents in the frame (TBD), more text might go here, remove any dust or debris while doing this.

#. Add a dust backing if needed (see separate topic).

#. Wire the frame (TBD) more text might go here, this process will differ depending on whether you are making a regular frame or an |ez| frame.

#. Finish up the frame creation (see separate topic).

Now you have a wonderful new frame! Clean up the work area, and make sure everything is put away. Arrange for supplies to be replenished. Update the inventory control system. Either package the frame and store it, or prepare it for upcoming delivery. Inform the appropriate people that the frame is ready.
