The materials you will need in order to finish the frame with bumpers and labels are:

* two rubber bumpers
* a hot glue gun with glue sticks that will dry clear
* a nearby electric outlet for the glue gun
* a Dymo label maker, Dymo software installed on your computer, label files ready with logo and basic text, blank labels (add external link to Dymo website) (show picture of label layout)
* a soft surface to rest the frame on while working to protect the frame from scratches, such as a fluffy white bath towel
* a protective surface to put the hot glue gun on that will not melt nor allow hot glue to seep through or onto anything else

You will be adding a SKU number to the product label that corresponds to the type of product you are making. Frame products for |llc| have a SKU beginning with the letter "F". Here are some examples:

``FR09G`` refers to a regular frame, 9"x12", medium width gold moulding

``F318K``  refers to an |ez| frame for a 3D map, 18"x24", narrow width black moulding

The five characters for frame SKUs are explained below:

Finish the New Frame
********************

.. warning::
   Be careful not to touch the hot glue or the tip of the glue gun while it is hot!

.. warning::
   While the glue gun is hot, keep it positioned over or on a protective surface that will not melt nor allow the hot glue to go where it is not wanted.

Add rubber bumpers and labels to the new frame:

#. Gather the supplies.

#. Plug in the hot glue gun. Make sure a glue stick is fully inserted. If necessary, use a second glue stick to push the first one in fully. Wait a few minutes for the glue gun to warm up until you can squeeze hot glue out of the glue gun.

#. Peel the backing off the rubber bumpers. Apply the bumpers using the hot glue gun, since the adhesive that comes with the bumpers does not always hold over time. Add a diagram of where to place the bumpers. Unplug the glue gun. Let it cool down while you continue.

#. Add labels, as many as are required for this product. Explain more...Use Dymo. Possibly more than one label if there are contents, one for the contents and one for the frame. And maybe one for a map disclosure.

#. Arrange for supplies to be replenished.

.. warning::
   Make sure the glue gun is cool enough before putting it away!
